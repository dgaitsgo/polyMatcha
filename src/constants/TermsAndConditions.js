`Hello, and welcome to the Terms and Services. We're glad you were able to take the time to learn more about what we do with your data here at polyMatcha. We know parsing through hundreds of lines of legalese that isn't ultimately binding is painful, so we've done our best to condense the important points.

1. All your shit is ours. We track your every mouse movment. We even detect your scent.

2. If it's worth our while, we will sell your data to the highest bidder. It's a free site after all, you're not the customer, you're the product.

3. We have reasonable security. But that's according to us and there's not a single security engineer on this humble team, so your data and privacy is not safe. Like at all.

4. If you come to this site to start any kind of trouble or to spread racist/ISIS propoganda, we'll hand over everything little thing to the FBI. We're snitches like that.

5. Is this site not working how you'd expect? Fuck you. We're proud engineers, not feature nanny's looking to improve your life. This is our baby, learn to love it or don't be part of this family.

6. Well, we couldn't only have 5.

7. In the interest of our tranquility, there is no support. You have a problem? Go on github, open an issue, or who knows, maybe we'll have a pull request. Don't know what any of that means? Learn how to write some code, then complain, then start at step 7 again.

8. Uhhh, what else? Right. Nothing is our fault. Don't try to sue us. Our servers are in information havens that would never hand over data to some chump like you or his two-bit lawyer. And well if you go after me personally for negligence, well think about what you've just read. I've explicitely stated that everything that could go wrong with your data probably will. You decided to still use it. Sue yourself.

9. So close to double digits!

10. Sometimes I feel like a woman trapped in a man's body.

11. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts for joining this inherintly creepy dating site. We hope you don't get kidnapped or coerced into something... awkward. Should any of this happen to you whilst using our website, I reiterate, there is no support. You have to dial 911 and not mention where you met the culprit.

12. Send wholesome memes.`
